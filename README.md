# Emotioin-Detector
Emotion Detector is a Python app trained on the FER-2013 dataset using TensorFlow/Keras to classify emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral) in images and live video. OpenCV handles real-time processing, Tkinter provides a GUI, and tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Pillow support robust emotion detection and visualization.
